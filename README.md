# Phishing Sites Tracker

This repository tracks the phishing sites that were detected by our application. Given our capacity at the current scale, we have only taken proactive steps to report a handful of these sites to Metamask for the appropriate course of action.

## Methodology

Our approach to identifying and reporting phishing sites combines automated detection with thorough manual review to ensure high accuracy. We prioritize the integrity of legitimate sites and strive to prevent false positives.

Our product has the ability to mass report these phishing sites across a suite of vendors, making the process of taking a phishing site down extremely seamless. We believe, given the depth of the situation at stake, that the job should be entirely performed by the team who have found a website that is impersonating them, because a false report would be a catastrophe if a genuine site gets wrongly reported, blocked, or taken down.
